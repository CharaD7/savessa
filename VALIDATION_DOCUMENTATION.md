# Input Validation Documentation

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive documentation for the input validation implemented in the Savessa app's registration screen. It includes information about the validation requirements, implementation details, and testing procedures.

## Validation Requirements

The following validation requirements were implemented:

1. **Email Validation**:
   - Comprehensive format validation using regex
   - Verification of email existence and activity (at least one day old)
   - Visual indicators (green checkmark for valid, red cross for invalid)
   - Prevention of progression until a valid email is entered

2. **Password Validation**:
   - Strong password policy enforcement (length, complexity, special characters)
   - Check against known breached databases ("Have I Been Pwned")
   - Visual password strength indicator
   - Prevention of progression until a valid password is entered

3. **Confirm Password Validation**:
   - Matching validation against the password field
   - Visual indicators for validation status
   - Prevention of form submission until confirmation matches

## Implementation Details

### ValidatedTextField Widget

A new `ValidatedTextField` widget was created to extend the functionality of the original `AppTextField` widget. This widget includes:

- Support for validation status indicators (green checkmark, red cross, loading indicator)
- Async validation support with debounce mechanism
- Focus management to control field progression
- Prevention of progression when fields are invalid

### Email Validation Service

The `EmailValidatorService` provides comprehensive email validation:

- Format validation using a robust regex pattern
- API integration with Abstract API for email verification
- Checks for deliverability, disposable email addresses, and domain validity
- Quality score assessment as a proxy for email age/activity
- Fallback mechanisms for API failures

### Password Validation Service

The `PasswordValidatorService` provides robust password validation:

- Policy enforcement (minimum length, character types, etc.)
- Strength assessment (weak, medium, strong, very strong)
- Integration with "Have I Been Pwned" API using k-anonymity model
- Visual strength indicator with color-coded feedback

### Form Submission Logic

The form submission logic was enhanced to:

- Track validation status of each field
- Prevent submission until all fields pass validation
- Provide clear error messages for invalid fields
- Focus on the first invalid field when attempting to submit

## Testing Procedures

To test the validation implementation:

### Email Validation Testing

1. **Format Validation**:
   - Enter a valid email format (e.g., user@example.com) → Should show green checkmark
   - Enter an invalid email format (e.g., user@, user@.com) → Should show red cross

2. **Existence and Activity Validation**:
   - Enter a known valid and active email → Should show green checkmark
   - Enter a disposable email (e.g., temp-mail.org) → Should show red cross
   - Enter an email with invalid domain → Should show red cross

### Password Validation Testing

1. **Policy Validation**:
   - Enter a password less than 8 characters → Should show red cross
   - Enter a password without uppercase letters → Should show red cross
   - Enter a password without lowercase letters → Should show red cross
   - Enter a password without numbers → Should show red cross
   - Enter a password without special characters → Should show red cross
   - Enter a password with common patterns (e.g., "password123") → Should show red cross
   - Enter a strong password meeting all requirements → Should show green checkmark

2. **Breach Validation**:
   - Enter a known breached password (e.g., "Password123!") → Should show red cross
   - Enter a unique, strong password → Should show green checkmark

3. **Strength Indicator**:
   - Enter a weak password → Should show red strength indicator
   - Enter a medium password → Should show orange strength indicator
   - Enter a strong password → Should show green strength indicator
   - Enter a very strong password → Should show dark green strength indicator

### Confirm Password Testing

1. **Matching Validation**:
   - Enter a password in the password field
   - Enter the same password in the confirm field → Should show green checkmark
   - Enter a different password in the confirm field → Should show red cross

### Form Submission Testing

1. **Validation Enforcement**:
   - Try to submit the form with invalid email → Should focus on email field with error message
   - Try to submit the form with invalid password → Should focus on password field with error message
   - Try to submit the form with invalid confirmation → Should focus on confirm field with error message
   - Submit the form with all valid fields → Should proceed with registration

## API Integration Notes

### Abstract API for Email Validation

- Free tier allows 100 requests per month
- API key needs to be replaced with a valid key in production
- Fallback mechanisms are in place for API failures

### Have I Been Pwned API for Password Validation

- Uses k-anonymity model for secure checking (only sends first 5 characters of password hash)
- No API key required
- Rate limiting may apply (consider implementing retry logic in production)

## Conclusion

The implemented validation system provides a robust and user-friendly way to ensure data quality and security in the registration process. The real-time feedback and prevention of progression until fields are valid help guide users to enter correct information without frustration.

## Future Improvements

1. **Caching**: Implement caching for API responses to reduce API calls
2. **Offline Support**: Add offline validation capabilities with sync when online
3. **Localization**: Add translations for all validation error messages
4. **Accessibility**: Enhance screen reader support for validation feedback
5. **Analytics**: Track validation failures to identify common user errors
