# Changes Summary

## Issue Requirements

The issue required the following changes:

1. Modify the sign-up screen to include slots for first name, last name, and other names
2. Reposition and restyle the Role selection as it looked odd with the radio button
3. Use the provided PostgreSQL connection details
4. Generate SQL commands needed for the PostgreSQL database

## Changes Made

### 1. Sign-up Screen Modifications

#### Translation Files

- Added new translation keys for first name, last name, and other names in both English and French:
  - English: "first_name": "First Name", "last_name": "Last Name", "other_names": "Other Names"
  - French: "first_name": "Pr√©nom", "last_name": "Nom de famille", "other_names": "Autres noms"

#### Register Screen UI

- Replaced the single full name field with three separate fields:
  - First Name (required)
  - Last Name (required)
  - Other Names (optional)
- Each field has appropriate validation and styling
- Used different icons for each field to visually distinguish them

#### Controller Updates

- Replaced the single `_fullNameController` with three separate controllers:
  - `_firstNameController`
  - `_lastNameController`
  - `_otherNamesController`
- Updated the `dispose()` method to properly dispose of these new controllers

### 2. Role Selection Redesign

- Redesigned the role selection UI to be more visually appealing:
  - Changed from simple radio buttons in a Row layout to a more structured design
  - Added a title for the Role section
  - Created a container with a border and rounded corners
  - Used RadioListTile widgets for each option (member and admin)
  - Added a divider between the options
  - Applied proper padding and spacing

### 3. PostgreSQL Integration

#### Database Service

- Created a `DatabaseService` class to handle PostgreSQL connections using the provided connection URI
- Implemented a singleton pattern to ensure only one instance of the service exists
- Added methods for connecting to and disconnecting from the database
- Added methods for executing queries and commands
- Added user-related methods for retrieving and creating users

#### Registration Logic

- Updated the registration logic to use the PostgreSQL database service
- Added email existence check before creating a new user
- Improved error handling and user feedback

### 4. SQL Commands Generation

- Created a comprehensive database schema with SQL commands for:
  - Users table (with first_name, last_name, other_names, email, phone, role, etc.)
  - Groups table
  - Group Members table
  - Savings table
  - Transactions table
  - Notifications table
  - Announcements table
  - Blockchain Records table
  - Savings Goals table
  - Audit Logs table
- Added appropriate indexes for performance optimization
- Added constraints for data integrity
- Added triggers for automatically updating timestamps
- Created common SQL queries for operations like user registration, authentication, etc.

## Documentation

- Created a comprehensive DATABASE_DOCUMENTATION.md file that documents:
  - Connection details for the PostgreSQL database
  - Complete SQL commands for creating all tables, indexes, and triggers
  - Descriptions of each table and its purpose
  - Common SQL queries for various operations
  - Database maintenance commands
