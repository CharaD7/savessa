## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### CMake Error: Unable to find Ninja build system

**Error Message:**
```
CMake Error: CMake was unable to find a build program corresponding to "Ninja". CMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM is not set. You probably need to select a different build tool.
CMake Error: CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER not set, after EnableLanguage
Error: Unable to generate build files
```

**Solution:**
1. Install the Ninja build system and C++ compiler:
   - **Linux:** `sudo apt-get install ninja-build cmake clang`
   - **Windows:** `choco install ninja cmake` and install Visual Studio with C++ build tools
   - **macOS:** `brew install ninja cmake`

2. If you can't install Ninja, you can configure Flutter to use a different CMake generator:
   ```bash
   # For Linux/macOS
   export CMAKE_GENERATOR="Unix Makefiles"
   flutter run
   
   # For Windows
   set CMAKE_GENERATOR="Visual Studio 16 2019"
   flutter run
   ```

#### Flutter pub get fails with dependency conflicts

**Solution:**
1. Try running with the `--no-pub-get` flag first:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get --no-pub-get
   ```
2. If that doesn't work, try upgrading dependencies:
   ```bash
   flutter pub upgrade --major-versions
   ```
3. If issues persist, check the `pubspec.yaml` for conflicting dependencies
