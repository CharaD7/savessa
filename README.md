lib/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ core/            # Core utilities, constants, and theme
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ features/        # Feature modules (auth, savings, groups, etc.)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ shared/          # Shared widgets and services
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ models/          # Data models
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ services/        # API and service integrations
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ main.dart        # Application entry point
```

**For Linux:**
- Clang or GCC (C++ compiler)
- Ninja build system
- GTK development headers
- Other dependencies:
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install clang cmake ninja-build pkg-config libgtk-3-dev
  ```

**For Windows:**
- Visual Studio with C++ build tools
- Windows 10 SDK

  ```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CharaD7/savessa.git
   cd savessa
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. Configure Firebase:
   - Create a Firebase project
   - Add Android and iOS apps to your Firebase project  
   - Download and add the configuration files
   - **Configure Environment Variables**: Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and update with your Firebase credentials (see [Firebase Configuration](#-firebase-configuration) below)

## üî• Firebase Configuration

Savessa uses environment variables to store Firebase credentials securely. This approach improves security by keeping sensitive information out of version control and allows for different configurations across development, staging, and production environments.

### Setting Up Environment Variables

1. **Copy the example file**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. **Get your Firebase credentials**:
   - Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
   - Select your project
   - Navigate to **Project Settings** (gear icon)
   - Scroll down to the **"Your apps"** section
   - For each platform (Web, Android, iOS, etc.), copy the respective configuration values

3. **Update your `.env` file** with the actual values:

```env
# Firebase Configuration
# Shared across all platforms
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-sender-id
FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-project-id.firebasestorage.app

# Platform-specific API Keys
FIREBASE_WEB_API_KEY=your-web-api-key
FIREBASE_ANDROID_API_KEY=your-android-api-key
FIREBASE_IOS_API_KEY=your-ios-api-key
FIREBASE_MACOS_API_KEY=your-macos-api-key
FIREBASE_WINDOWS_API_KEY=your-windows-api-key

# Platform-specific App IDs
FIREBASE_WEB_APP_ID=1:123456789:web:abcdef123456
FIREBASE_ANDROID_APP_ID=1:123456789:android:abcdef123456
FIREBASE_IOS_APP_ID=1:123456789:ios:abcdef123456
FIREBASE_MACOS_APP_ID=1:123456789:ios:abcdef123456  # Usually same as iOS
FIREBASE_WINDOWS_APP_ID=1:123456789:web:abcdef123456

# Web-specific configuration
FIREBASE_WEB_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-project-id.firebaseapp.com
FIREBASE_WEB_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX

# Windows-specific configuration
FIREBASE_WINDOWS_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-project-id.firebaseapp.com
FIREBASE_WINDOWS_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-YYYYYYYYYY

# iOS/macOS-specific configuration
FIREBASE_IOS_BUNDLE_ID=com.your-company.savessa
```

### Where to Find Each Value

#### From Firebase Console > Project Settings > Your Apps:

**Web App Configuration:**
- `FIREBASE_WEB_API_KEY` ‚Üí `apiKey`
- `FIREBASE_WEB_APP_ID` ‚Üí `appId`
- `FIREBASE_WEB_AUTH_DOMAIN` ‚Üí `authDomain`
- `FIREBASE_WEB_MEASUREMENT_ID` ‚Üí `measurementId`

**Android App Configuration:**
- `FIREBASE_ANDROID_API_KEY` ‚Üí From `google-services.json` ‚Üí `client[0].api_key[0].current_key`
- `FIREBASE_ANDROID_APP_ID` ‚Üí From `google-services.json` ‚Üí `client[0].client_info.mobilesdk_app_id`

**iOS App Configuration:**
- `FIREBASE_IOS_API_KEY` ‚Üí From `GoogleService-Info.plist` ‚Üí `API_KEY`
- `FIREBASE_IOS_APP_ID` ‚Üí From `GoogleService-Info.plist` ‚Üí `GOOGLE_APP_ID`
- `FIREBASE_IOS_BUNDLE_ID` ‚Üí From `GoogleService-Info.plist` ‚Üí `BUNDLE_ID`

**Shared Values:**
- `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID` ‚Üí Project ID (same across all platforms)
- `FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID` ‚Üí Sender ID (same across all platforms)
- `FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET` ‚Üí Storage bucket (same across all platforms)

### Environment File Security

- ‚úÖ **DO**: Keep `.env` file in your local development environment only
- ‚úÖ **DO**: Use different `.env` files for different environments (dev, staging, prod)
- ‚úÖ **DO**: Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file (already done in this project)
- ‚ùå **DON'T**: Commit `.env` files to version control
- ‚ùå **DON'T**: Share `.env` files via email or messaging
- ‚ùå **DON'T**: Include real credentials in screenshots or documentation

### Validation

The app automatically validates your Firebase configuration on startup:

- ‚úÖ **Success**: "Firebase environment configuration validated successfully"
- ‚ùå **Error**: Detailed error message showing which variables are missing or invalid

### Multiple Environments

For different environments, create separate `.env` files:

```bash
.env.development    # Local development
.env.staging        # Staging environment
.env.production     # Production environment
```

Then load the appropriate file:

```dart
// In main.dart, you can conditionally load different env files
await dotenv.load(fileName: '.env.${Environment.current}');
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### CMake Error: Unable to find Ninja build system

**Error Message:**
```
CMake Error: CMake was unable to find a build program corresponding to "Ninja". CMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM is not set. You probably need to select a different build tool.
CMake Error: CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER not set, after EnableLanguage
Error: Unable to generate build files
```

**Solution:**
1. Install the Ninja build system and C++ compiler:
   - **Linux:** `sudo apt-get install ninja-build cmake clang`
   - **Windows:** `choco install ninja cmake` and install Visual Studio with C++ build tools
   - **macOS:** `brew install ninja cmake`

2. If you can't install Ninja, you can configure Flutter to use a different CMake generator:
   ```bash
   # For Linux/macOS
   export CMAKE_GENERATOR="Unix Makefiles"
   flutter run
   
   # For Windows
   set CMAKE_GENERATOR="Visual Studio 16 2019"
   flutter run
   ```

#### Flutter pub get fails with dependency conflicts

**Solution:**
1. Try running with the `--no-pub-get` flag first:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get --no-pub-get
   ```
2. If that doesn't work, try upgrading dependencies:
   ```bash
   flutter pub upgrade --major-versions
   ```
3. If issues persist, check the `pubspec.yaml` for conflicting dependencies
