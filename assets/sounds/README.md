## Sound Guidelines

1. All sounds should be short, subtle, and not distracting.
2. Provide high-quality audio files optimized for mobile (MP3 format, 128-192 kbps).
3. Voice narrations should be clear, professional, and properly localized.
4. Sounds should be consistent across the app for similar actions.
5. Consider accessibility by ensuring sounds are not the only feedback mechanism.
