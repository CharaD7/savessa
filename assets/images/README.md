## Image Guidelines

1. All images should be provided in multiple resolutions (1x, 2x, 3x) for different screen densities.
2. Use the app's color scheme: Royal Purple (#6A0DAD), Metallic Gold (#FFD700), and Pure White (#FFFFFF).
3. Images should be optimized for mobile to minimize app size.
4. Provide both light and dark mode versions where appropriate.
5. Use SVG format where possible for better scaling.
