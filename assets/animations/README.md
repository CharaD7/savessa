## Animation Guidelines

1. All animations should be lightweight and optimized for mobile.
2. Use the app's color scheme: Royal Purple (#6A0DAD), Metallic Gold (#FFD700), and Pure White (#FFFFFF).
3. Animations should be subtle and enhance the user experience without being distracting.
4. Provide both light and dark mode versions where appropriate.
