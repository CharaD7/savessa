# Icon Changes Documentation

## Overview

This document provides information about the changes made to replace Material Icons with Feather Icons throughout the Savessa app. The changes were made to give the app a more modern and consistent look.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Feather Icons Package

Added the `feather_icons` package (version 1.2.0) to the project dependencies in `pubspec.yaml`.

### 2. Created Icon Mapping

Created a central icon mapping class in `lib/core/constants/icon_mapping.dart` to ensure consistency across the app. This class provides a mapping from Material Icons to Feather Icons.

### 3. Updated Icons in UI Components

Replaced Material Icons with Feather Icons in the following components:

#### Registration Screen
- First name field: `Icons.person` → `FeatherIcons.user`
- Last name field: `Icons.person_outline` → `FeatherIcons.user`
- Other names field: `Icons.people_outline` → `FeatherIcons.users`
- Email field: `Icons.email` → `FeatherIcons.mail`
- Phone field: `Icons.phone` → `FeatherIcons.phone`
- Password field: `Icons.lock` → `FeatherIcons.lock`
- Confirm password field: `Icons.lock_outline` → `FeatherIcons.lock`

#### Login Screen
- Email field: `Icons.email` → `FeatherIcons.mail`
- Password field: `Icons.lock` → `FeatherIcons.lock`

#### Home Screen
- Notifications icon: `Icons.notifications` → `FeatherIcons.bell`
- Settings icon: `Icons.settings` → `FeatherIcons.settings`
- Info icon: `Icons.info_outline` → `FeatherIcons.info`
- Add savings icon: `Icons.add_circle` → `FeatherIcons.plusCircle`
- View history icon: `Icons.history` → `FeatherIcons.clock`
- Join group icon: `Icons.group_add` → `FeatherIcons.userPlus`
- Create group icon: `Icons.add_box` → `FeatherIcons.plus`
- Activity up arrow: `Icons.arrow_upward` → `FeatherIcons.arrowUp`
- Activity down arrow: `Icons.arrow_downward` → `FeatherIcons.arrowDown`

#### Bottom Navigation Bar
- Home tab: `Icons.home` → `FeatherIcons.home`
- Savings tab: `Icons.savings` → `FeatherIcons.dollarSign`
- Groups tab: `Icons.group` → `FeatherIcons.users`
- Analytics tab: `Icons.bar_chart` → `FeatherIcons.barChart2`
- Profile tab: `Icons.person` → `FeatherIcons.user`

#### Text Field Component
- Clear button: `Icons.clear` → `FeatherIcons.x`
- Password visibility toggle: `Icons.visibility_off` → `FeatherIcons.eyeOff`
- Password visibility toggle: `Icons.visibility` → `FeatherIcons.eye`

### 4. Made "Other Names" Field Optional

Verified that the "other names" field in the registration screen is truly optional:
- No validator is applied to the field
- The database schema defines the field as nullable
- The registration logic handles empty values appropriately

## Testing Instructions

To test the icon changes:

1. Run `flutter pub get` to ensure the feather_icons package is installed
2. Run the app with `flutter run`
3. Navigate through the app and verify that all icons display correctly
4. Check the following screens specifically:
   - Login screen
   - Registration screen
   - Home screen
   - Bottom navigation bar
5. Test the text fields to ensure the clear button and password visibility toggle icons work correctly
6. Test the registration form with and without the "other names" field to verify it's truly optional

## Known Issues

None identified. All icons should display correctly.

## Future Improvements

Consider the following improvements for the future:

1. Add custom icon animations for better user experience
2. Create themed icons that change color based on the app's theme
3. Add accessibility labels to icons for screen readers

## Conclusion

The app now uses Feather Icons throughout the UI, providing a more modern and consistent look. The "other names" field in the registration form is confirmed to be optional, allowing users to skip it if desired.
